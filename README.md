## Script for bioinformatics of genomic surveillance from GISAID database. 

Statistics on the number of cases vs. covariates (sex, age and location) are produced from SARS-COV2 cases count. Frequencies and temporal distributions of lineages reveal peaks, time of appearance of new variants, waves and cycles.
The geographic distribution of SARS-COV2 cases can be analyzed is also shown the in the form of maps describing the location of the cases. Finally, phylogeny combined with PCA reveal samples that are not properly grouped - suggesting a new possible new variant.
